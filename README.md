## Overview

Blue Hole is a **FREE** configuration and addon for Blender designed to significantly speed up your workflow, particularly for game development. It brings powerful tools and a consistent user experience inspired by industry-standard 3D software like 3ds Max, MODO, and Maya.

## Features

Blue Hole provides a curated collection of scripts, pie menus, and keymaps to streamline common tasks.  Here's a breakdown:

### Blue Hole Scripts

A new **Blue Hole Header Menu** unlocks easy access to these powerful scripts:

*   **Batch Export:**  Quickly export meshes in a structured format for game engines.
    *   Customizable Project Folder Structure
*   **Blender to Game Engine Bridges:** Simplify importing assets into popular game engines.
    *   Blender to Unity Bridge
    *   Blender to Unreal Engine 4 & 5 Bridge
*   **Source Control Integration:**  Seamlessly connect to version control systems.
    *   Perforce Support
    *   Plastic SCM Support
*   **Automatic Updates:** Keep your Blue Hole tools up-to-date with ease.
*   **Miscellaneous Tools:**  Enhance your workflow with helpful utilities:
    *   Objects Sorter
    *   Find and Rename

### Deluxe Edition (Optional)

Blue Hole isn't just about scripts. The Deluxe Edition also includes: 

*   **Hand-Crafted Pie Menus:** Intuitive and context-sensitive pie menus designed for artists.
*   **Custom Keymaps:**  Optimized keybindings to accelerate your modeling process.
*   **Disclaimer!!!:** The use of the Deluxe Edition overwrites your Blender preference file (`userprefs.blend`)

## Inspiration & Philosophy

Blue Hole is inspired by the best features of professional 3D software packages.  We believe in:

*   **Efficiency:** Reducing clicks and streamlining repetitive tasks.
*   **Consistency:**  A user experience that feels familiar across applications. We aim to recreate the core functionality of tools like Maya's "Tools" (SHIFT-RMB) and "Actions" (CTRL-RMB) pies.
*   **Context Sensitivity:** Options that adapt to your current selection and workflow.

**Stop relearning how to play the piano every time you switch applications!**  Blue Hole's standardized contextual pie menus create a comfortable and productive environment.
